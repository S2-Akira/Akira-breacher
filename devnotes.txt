Akira Breacher - Development Notes (devnotes.txt)
Overview:
Akira Breacher is a versatile brute-force tool designed to perform brute-force attacks on various protocols such as SSH, FTP, and HTTP Basic Auth. The tool leverages a simple GUI, making it accessible for both experienced users and beginners. Its modular design allows for easy extension to support additional protocols or features.

Features:
GUI with Tkinter: Provides a user-friendly interface for easy configuration and control of brute-force attacks.

SSH Brute Force: Allows targeting SSH servers with customizable credentials (username, charset, max password length).

FTP Brute Force: Similar to SSH but targets FTP servers, with login capabilities using custom credentials.

HTTP Basic Auth Brute Force: Targets HTTP-based authentication mechanisms, allowing brute-forcing on web apps with basic authentication.

Dark Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes for better user experience, especially in low-light environments.

AI Guess Mode: Experimental mode that could use AI to intelligently guess passwords based on common patterns.

Start/Stop Functionality: Start and stop brute-force attacks in real-time, with live logging of attempted passwords and success/failure statuses.

Libraries Used:
paramiko (v2.11.0): Handles SSH connections and performs brute force on SSH servers.

requests (v2.28.2): Used for making HTTP requests for Basic Authentication checks.

ftplib (Standard Library): Manages FTP connections for brute force attacks on FTP servers.

tkinter: Used for the graphical user interface (GUI), making the tool more accessible.

threading: Allows the tool to run attacks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.

itertools: Utilized for generating password combinations based on the specified charset and length.

TODO / Future Improvements:
GPU Utilization for Brute Force:

Research and implement GPU support for accelerating password generation and testing, particularly using libraries like pyCUDA or TensorFlow.

This can significantly speed up brute-force attacks on high-end machines.

AI-powered Guess Mode:

Further development of the AI-powered mode for more intelligent password guessing (e.g., predicting weak or commonly used passwords).

Could integrate libraries like OpenAI's GPT models or custom machine learning models.

Proxy Support:

Add proxy functionality for masking the real IP address during attacks to enhance anonymity and bypass rate-limiting mechanisms on target servers.

Expanded Protocol Support:

Add support for additional protocols such as Telnet, SMB, or custom web application login forms.

Captcha Bypass:

Research potential ways to bypass CAPTCHA protection (e.g., reCAPTCHA) that some websites use to block brute force attacks.

Rate Limiting:

Introduce rate-limiting mechanisms for the tool to avoid detection or throttling by targets.

Implement delays or sleep intervals between attempts to prevent getting blocked.

Logging and Reporting:

Enhance logging features to create detailed attack logs that store the status of each attempt, timestamps, and output to external files.

Implement reporting features for attack results to make it easier for users to analyze the success/failure rate.

User Authentication:

Add authentication (via API tokens or OAuth) to secure the use of the tool in certain contexts (e.g., for web-based attacks).

Error Handling:

Improve error handling for failed connections, retries, and exceptions to make the tool more robust.

Provide clearer feedback for the user when attacks fail (e.g., invalid credentials, unreachable host).

Known Issues:
Timeouts: Some targets may timeout if the server has strict rate-limiting, causing failed attempts.

Captcha: Basic HTTP auth-based attacks might be blocked by websites using CAPTCHA or other bot-prevention techniques.

Limited AI Guess Mode: Currently, AI Guess Mode is a placeholder and doesn't implement any real intelligence. Future versions will improve this functionality.

Development Notes:
Design Philosophy: The tool was designed with simplicity and versatility in mind. It is modular, allowing for easy expansion to include additional protocols, attack types, or functionalities in the future.

Tkinter Limitations: While Tkinter is good for creating basic GUIs, there might be performance issues with more complex features (like handling large logs or real-time attack results). Consider exploring other GUI libraries (e.g., PyQt) for more complex or resource-intensive features.

Multi-threading: Threading was used for handling brute-force attacks concurrently. Ensure that the tool properly manages resources when scaling to large numbers of threads to avoid overloading the system.
